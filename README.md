# Literature Review


# Problem Statements
1. The company has a clear understanding of how customers feel about its product or service, and can use this information to make informed decisions about how to improve and market its offerings. The company lacks a reliable way to track and analyze customer sentiment on social media. As a result, it is unable to accurately gauge how customers feel about its product or service, and may be missing out on valuable insights. Creating a social media sentiment analysis webapp that allows the company to track and analyze customer sentiment on social media in real-time. This will enable the company to identify trends and patterns in customer feedback, identify common themes or issues, and respond quickly to potential crises or negative events.

2. The company is able to identify and address customer complaints and issues in a timely manner, leading to increased customer satisfaction. The company is unaware of many customer complaints or issues because they are not being shared on social media or are being shared in a way that is difficult to track. As a result, the company is unable to address these issues and may be losing customers as a result. Create a social media sentiment analysis webapp that allows the company to monitor social media for customer complaints and issues. This will enable the company to identify and address these issues in a timely manner, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

# Methodology
1. Define the project objectives: The first step will be to clearly define the objectives of the project. This will involve identifying the specific questions that the webapp is intended to answer, such as the overall sentiment of customers towards the company's product or service, common themes or issues in customer feedback, and the potential for negative events or crises.

2. Identify the target audience: Next, it will be important to identify the specific social media platforms and user groups that the webapp will target. This will involve researching the demographics and online behavior of the target audience, as well as determining which platforms they are most active on.

3. Collect and organize the data: The webapp will then need to collect and organize data from the targeted social media platforms. This will involve using appropriate data-gathering techniques, such as web scraping or API access, to gather relevant posts and comments from the targeted platforms. The data will then need to be cleaned and organized in a way that allows for easy analysis.

4. Store the data: The webapp will be able to store said data into a long term database storage, preferably on a secure and trusted 3rd party service provider for future queries and history tracking.

5. Analyze the data: Once the data has been collected and organized, it can be analyzed using appropriate tools and techniques. This may involve using natural language processing to identify the sentiment of individual posts, or using statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data.

6. Present the results: The final step will be to present the results of the analysis in a clear and concise manner. This may involve creating visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate the findings, as well as writing a report that summarizes the key takeaways.

Throughout this process, it will be important to ensure that the data-gathering techniques used are appropriate and ethical, and that the results of the analysis are presented in a way that is accurate and unbiased.
