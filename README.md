# Literature Review
## Sentiment Analysis and History
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on extracting and analyzing the sentiment expressed in written or spoken language. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the overall attitude or emotional valence of a piece of text, whether positive, negative, or neutral.

The history of sentiment analysis can be traced back to the early 1960s, when researchers first began exploring ways to automatically classify text as positive or negative. Early efforts focused on the use of simple keyword lists or dictionaries to identify sentiment, but these approaches were limited in their ability to accurately capture the complexity and nuance of human emotion.

In the 1990s, with the advent of machine learning techniques, researchers began exploring more sophisticated approaches to sentiment analysis. These approaches made use of supervised learning algorithms, in which a training dataset of labeled text is used to teach the model to classify new, unseen text as positive or negative. These early machine learning models were able to achieve higher levels of accuracy than previous approaches, but still had limitations in their ability to accurately capture the context and subtleties of human emotion.

Over the past two decades, sentiment analysis has become an increasingly important tool in a variety of fields, including marketing, customer service, and political analysis. With the explosion of social media and other online platforms, there is a vast amount of written text available for analysis, making sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding and tracking public opinion.

One key individual in the development of sentiment analysis is Bing Liu, a researcher who has made significant contributions to the field through his work on sentiment lexicons and machine learning approaches. Liu's work has helped to advance the accuracy and capabilities of sentiment analysis models and has been widely influential in the field.

Today, sentiment analysis is commonly used in a variety of applications, including social media monitoring, product review analysis, and customer service. It is also used in political analysis to track and understand public sentiment on various issues.

There are a variety of sentiment analysis tools and services available on the market, ranging from simple keyword-based approaches to more sophisticated machine learning models. These tools and services can be used by businesses and organizations to track and understand public sentiment, as well as to identify trends and patterns in customer feedback.

Looking to the future, it is likely that sentiment analysis will continue to evolve and improve as machine learning techniques and NLP technology advance. It is also likely that sentiment analysis will be used in an increasingly wide variety of applications, as the ability to automatically extract and analyze sentiment from text becomes more widely available.

## Pre-existing Sentiment Analysis Tools and Packages in R Language
R programming is a popular language for data analysis and has a variety of packages, tools and resources available for performing sentiment analysis of social media text. In this review, we will explore some of the most commonly used options and compare their accuracy, speed, and customization options with packages available in Python.

One popular package for sentiment analysis in R is the "sentimentr" package, developed by Tyler Rinker. This package uses lexical dictionaries to classify the sentiment of text, with options for adjusting the intensity of sentiment and handling negation. It also includes functions for extracting sentiment from social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. One advantage of sentimentr is its simplicity and speed, as it relies on pre-defined dictionaries rather than machine learning algorithms. However, its accuracy may be limited by the fixed nature of the dictionaries and its inability to handle more complex language.

Another option in R is the "syuzhet" package, developed by Tyler Rinker and Matthew J. Jockers. This package uses machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of text and includes functions for extracting sentiment from various sources including novels and movies. One advantage of syuzhet is its ability to handle more complex language and its higher level of accuracy compared to sentimentr. However, it may be slower due to the use of machine learning algorithms and may require more customization and data preparation.

In comparison to these packages in R, Python has a number of options for sentiment analysis including the "TextBlob" library and the "Vader" library. TextBlob uses machine learning algorithms and a pre-defined lexicon to classify the sentiment of text, with the option for custom training. It also includes functions for various natural language processing tasks such as lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging. One advantage of TextBlob is its simplicity and ease of use, however it may not be as accurate as more sophisticated machine learning approaches.

Vader, developed by C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text. It uses a combination of lexical dictionaries and rules to classify the sentiment of text, with the option for adjusting the intensity of sentiment. One advantage of Vader is its ability to handle social media specific language and its high level of accuracy. However, it may be limited in its ability to handle more complex language and may require more customization for specific domains.

In summary, R and Python both have a range of packages, tools and resources available for performing sentiment analysis of social media text. R packages such as sentimentr and syuzhet offer simplicity and speed, but may have limited accuracy. Python libraries such as TextBlob and Vader offer higher accuracy but may require more customization and data preparation. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the specific needs and resources of the project.

## Web Application Frameworks available in R Language
There are several web application frameworks available for R programming that can be used to perform sentiment analysis of social media text. In this literature review, we will discuss the origin, uses, advantages, and disadvantages of these frameworks, as well as their attributes and options in comparison with frameworks available in Python.

One popular web application framework for R is Shiny. Shiny was developed by RStudio and was released in 2012. It allows users to build interactive web applications using R, with the ability to add input widgets such as text boxes, sliders, and drop-down menus, and output widgets such as plots and tables. Shiny applications can be hosted locally or on a server, and can be accessed via a web browser.

Shiny has several advantages for sentiment analysis of social media text. It allows users to easily create interactive visualizations of sentiment data, such as word clouds and bar charts. It also provides a wide range of input and output widgets, which can be used to build user-friendly interfaces for text analysis.

However, Shiny also has some disadvantages. It can be difficult for users with limited programming experience to build complex applications, and the coding can be time-consuming. Additionally, Shiny applications can be slow to load, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Another web application framework for R is plumber. Plumber was developed by RStudio and was released in 2016. It allows users to build REST APIs (representational state transfer application programming interfaces) using R, which can be used to access sentiment analysis functions and data from other applications. Plumber APIs can be hosted locally or on a server, and can be accessed via HTTP requests.

Plumber has several advantages for sentiment analysis of social media text. It allows users to easily create APIs for text analysis functions, which can be accessed by other applications. It also provides a simple syntax for creating and testing APIs, which can be useful for users with limited programming experience.

However, plumber also has some disadvantages. It does not provide as many input and output widgets as Shiny, so it may not be as user-friendly for building interactive applications. Additionally, plumber APIs may not be as efficient as other options for handling large datasets.

In comparison with frameworks available in Python, R web application frameworks have some advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, R frameworks such as Shiny and plumber provide specific functions and packages for sentiment analysis, which may be more convenient for users who are already familiar with R. On the other hand, Python frameworks such as Flask and Django may have a larger user base and more resources available for learning and development.

Overall, Shiny and plumber are two popular web application frameworks for R programming that can be used for sentiment analysis of social media text. Both frameworks have their own strengths and weaknesses, and which one is the best choice will depend on the specific needs and goals of the user.
